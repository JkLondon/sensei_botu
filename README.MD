Me and my friends were needed in bot that would simply forward our sensei's messages from whatsapp and send it to our telegram group 

To run enable CGO and run the following command
```bash
go run main.go
```
You will need to use some qr code pics generator (for example this: https://www.qr-code-generator.com/solutions/text-qr-code/)
and scan the qr code with your whatsapp app twice to authenticate. This you should do only once
